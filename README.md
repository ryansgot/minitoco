# RS Minitoco

This is the minitoco app that simulates a means of exchanging minitoco between users. There is both a server app ([server](server/README.md)) and a client app ([client](reactclient/README.md)). You can also use the swagger docs of the server application (which will be available at http://localhost:3050/docs after you run the service).
